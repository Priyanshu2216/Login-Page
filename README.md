# Login-Page
this is my first project made by me
The website features a login page designed using HTML and CSS within Visual Studio Code. The page includes essential elements such as username and password fields, a login button, a “forgot password” option, and a “remember me” checkbox. This user-friendly design allows visitors to input their login credentials and access the website’s protected content with ease.
